function i4_modp ( i, j )
  
    !*****************************************************************************80
    !
    !! I4_MODP returns the nonnegative remainder of I4 division.
    !
    !  Discussion:
    !
    !    The MOD function computes a result with the same sign as the
    !    quantity being divided.  Thus, suppose you had an angle A,
    !    and you wanted to ensure that it was between 0 and 360.
    !    Then mod(A,360) would do, if A was positive, but if A
    !    was negative, your result would be between -360 and 0.
    !
    !    On the other hand, I4_MODP(A,360) is between 0 and 360, always.
    !
    !    If
    !      NREM = I4_MODP ( I, J )
    !      NMULT = ( I - NREM ) / J
    !    then
    !      I = J * NMULT + NREM
    !    where NREM is always nonnegative.
    !
    !  Example:
    !
    !        I     J     MOD  I4_MODP    Factorization
    !
    !      107    50       7       7    107 =  2 *  50 + 7
    !      107   -50       7       7    107 = -2 * -50 + 7
    !     -107    50      -7      43   -107 = -3 *  50 + 43
    !     -107   -50      -7      43   -107 =  3 * -50 + 43
